# GoGagaSample
Test Project for GoGaga//

The project is a based on the preferences page of GoGgaga app on the playstore |

It uses a similar color scheme to the app //
The check boxes are used instead of radio button or any other selector as it enables the user to select either one or even both the options (men, women) //
As the age preference increases the concentration of alcohol in each of the drinks displayed increases. (the idea stems from the fact that the logo of the app is a wine glass)//
Beer 4%
Wine 12%
Martini 32%
Gin 40% 
Whiskey 42% + 
//
When most of the apps are moving towards  minimalism  it seems perfectly fit to incorporate that into the app especially on a page where the user  need to choose and select options.//
Material design promotes us to use buttons in a way they are clearly visible to the user //
The user can clearly see the buttons and choices in this design  //
